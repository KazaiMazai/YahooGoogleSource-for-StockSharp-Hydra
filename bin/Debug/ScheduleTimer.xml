            IParameterSetter represents a serialized parameter list.  This is used to provide a partial specialized
            method call.  This is useful for remote invocation of method calls.  For example if you have a method with
            3 parameters.  The first 2 might represent static data such as a report and a storage location.  The third
            might be the time that the report is invoked, which is only known when the method is invoked.  Using this,
            you just pass the method and the first 2 parameters to a timer object, which supplies the 3rd parameter.
            Without these objects, you would have to generate a custom object type for each method you wished to 
            execute in this manner and store the static parameters as instance variables.

            <summary>
            ScheduleTimer represents a timer that fires on a more human friendly schedule.  For example it is easy to 
            set it to fire every day at 6:00PM.  It is useful for batch jobs or alarms that might be difficult to 
            schedule with the native .net timers.
            It is similar to the .net timer that it is based on with the start and stop methods functioning similarly.
            The main difference is the event uses a different delegate and arguement since the .net timer argument 
            class is not creatable.
